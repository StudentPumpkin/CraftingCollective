The file structure you find in this file is exactly how it is uploaded to my simmons web space.
If you would like to replicate it, just upload all the files as it and you should be good to go.

If you make any updates, please make sure to notify everyone in discord and make the files publically avalible somehow.
This way this can countinue and be as up to date as possible.

I'll do my best to keep my files as current as possible here.
