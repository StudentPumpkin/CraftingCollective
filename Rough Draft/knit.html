        <p> On his channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkg45GHzMdEBXl8BA8FtPpw">RJ Knits</a>, RJ Collett explores different ways
            of knitting, tecniques for knitters of all levels. He is a self proclaimed "author, knitter, and animator" and on his channel,
            he makes "videos you can wear". His videos are informative and easy to follow, and are good for anyone who wants to learn, or
            sharpen their kniting skills.

        <p>Since knitting uses both hands regularly, you might be wondering how it can be left or right handed. But despite the usage of both
            hands, which direction you knit in depends on which is your dominent hand. If you are left hand dominant, or simply find knitting with
            your right hand dominant too difficult, try with your left hand!

            just in case you need a snugger or looser fit. The pattern is sectioned off

        <p>This Afghan pattern is beautiful, and covers many different motifs from the north,
            including a moose, and  snowflake. The motifs are separated, so this pattern
            for a blanket or pillow covering does not have a specific size, as you can simply
            keep adding more motifs until you&#39;re satisfied. This pattern is also offered with
            an option to buy the yarn, but if you choose something different, there&#39;s no reason
            you won&#39;t end up with this beautiful design. This pattern also comes with tips for
            cleaning the finished product, so you don&#39;t have to fear spils or other wear.
