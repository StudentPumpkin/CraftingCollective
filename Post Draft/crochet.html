        <h1>Crochet</h1>
        <p>If you like to work with yarn but find knitting a few too many needles, then a
            crochet hook will gladly help you along. Crocheting is all about making slip knots
            and weaving togeher yarn. Unlike some other kinds of manu=ipulating yarn, crocheting
            is relatively new, and only dates to the 1800&#39;s. But that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s a lack
            of patterns.
